Concept description: For this final assignment I wanted to create a sporadic art piece based on different variales in my data set. The final image is an image of pink and green music notes along 3 rows of staff lines to represent measures. Every song in the data set is represented by 1 music note. The music note's color (Pink or Green) is affected by danceability, the size (30 pixels or 100 pixels) is affected by shape and the type of note (quarter note or eigth note) is affected by the tempo of the song. The position of the notes are randomized to create a sporadic image. 

Data source and mapping strategy: The data source for this project is "KPoP.csv" which is my personal playlist which I plugged into exportify to create the data set.

Instructions to run the code: "Truong_data_art.py" contains all my main game functions and "visual_objects.py" is all my class defintiions. To run the program, all the images, "Truong_data_art.py", need to be in the same directory. Then the program can be ran from "Truong_data_art.py"
