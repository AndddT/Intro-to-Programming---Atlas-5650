Concept description: For this final assignment I wanted to create a sporadic art piece based on different variales in my data set. The final image is an image of pink and green music notes along 3 rows of staff lines to represent measures. 

Data source: The data source for this project is "KPoP.csv" which is my personal playlist which I plugged into exportify to create the data set. 

Mapping Strategy: Every song in the data set is represented by 1 music note. The music note's color (Pink or Green) is affected by danceability (danceabiliity score .3 -.65 makes the notes pink. . 65 - 1 makes the notes green). The size of the music note is determined by the energy of the song (Energy score of .2 - .4 = 30 pixels, .4 - .6 = 100 pixels). The type of note is affected by the tempo of the song (68 - 124 bpm creates a quarter note and 124 - 180 bpm creates an eigth note). The staff lines were drawn across aproximately the beginning, middle and end of the image. 

Instructions to run the code: "Truong_data_art.py" contains all my main game functions and "visual_objects.py" is all my class defintiions. To run the program, all the image files (greenQuarterNote, greenEigthNote, pinkQuarterNote, pinkEigthNote), "Truong_data_art.py", need to be in the same directory. Then the program can be ran from "Truong_data_art.py"
